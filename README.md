# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient using machine learning. It utilizes the Random Forest Algorithm to build a predictive model based on a given dataset.

---

## 📜 Description

The primary goal of this project is to implement a machine learning model that can accurately predict heart disease. The model is built using a **Random Forest Classifier**, a powerful ensemble learning method, and trained on the included `heart.csv` dataset.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is `heart.csv`. This file contains various medical attributes of patients, which are used as features for the prediction model.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

* **Python**: The core language used for scripting and model building.
* **Scikit-learn**: (Assumed) Used for implementing the Random Forest Algorithm.
* **Pandas**: (Assumed) Used for data loading and manipulation.
* **NumPy**: (Assumed) Used for numerical operations.
